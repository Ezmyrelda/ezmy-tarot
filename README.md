# ezmy-tarot
A ruby tarot program designed to be as minimal and elegant as possible.

Ezmy Tarot is a a hobbiests first serious venture into the world of app development.. 
This might be the basis for something larger that we have been wanting to work on for a while.
Or it might be the older sister to that something with a very specific purpose.. 

What I hope for this app is that it at the very least develops into a minimal and quick way to serve 
a reading from a pack of 78 cards to the terminal.

I specifically want it to be a mainly terminal based app in order to have it spit out readings for an ebooks bot.. 
More on that later..

Changelog:
Made it an Array.. It needs to stay an array.. There's no reason for it to be a hash.. Learn from Marie.
